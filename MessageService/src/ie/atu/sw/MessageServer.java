/* MessageServer is responsible for creating an instance of the remote object (MessageServiceImpl)
 * and binding it to a naming server (the RMI Registry) with a human-readable name. The RMI registry
 * can be started from the command line with the "rmiregistry" command, or programmatically using:
 * 
 *			LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
 * 
 * 		where 1099 is the port number that the registry is listening on for incoming client requests.
 *
 * Note: When a client asks the RMI registry for an object, the registry returns an instance of the
 * remote interface - a stub, which is really a dynamic remote proxy.
